Time series modeling is a statistical technique used to analyze and forecast time-dependent data, such as stock prices, weather data, sales, or other types of data that change over time. Time series data is different from cross-sectional data, which consists of observations made at one point in time, and is typically used in supervised learning problems such as classification and regression.

There are several types of time series models that can be used for forecasting, including:

Autoregressive models (AR) - These models use previous values of the time series to predict future values. An autoregressive model of order p, denoted AR(p), is a model where the current value is a linear combination of the previous p values.

Moving average models (MA) - These models use the residual errors from a forecast made by another model, such as an AR model, to predict future values. A moving average model of order q, denoted MA(q), is a model where the current value is a linear combination of the previous q residual errors.

Autoregressive moving average models (ARMA) - These models combine both autoregressive and moving average models to produce forecasts. An autoregressive moving average model of order (p,q), denoted ARMA(p,q), is a model where the current value is a linear combination of the previous p values and the previous q residual errors.

Autoregressive integrated moving average models (ARIMA) - These models are used when the time series data is not stationary, meaning that the mean and variance change over time. ARIMA models include a term to account for this non-stationarity, and are denoted ARIMA(p,d,q), where d is the order of differencing used to make the data stationary.

Seasonal decomposition of Time series (STL) - This is a method for decomposing a time series into its component parts: trend, seasonal and residuals, it allows for analyzing each component separately.

Exponential smoothing - This is a method for forecasting data that emphasizes more recent observations and assigns exponentially decreasing weights to older observations, depending on the method of smoothing used.

Each type of time series model has its own advantages and disadvantages, and choosing the right one will depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the forecasting problem at hand. It's important to have a good understanding of time series analysis and time series modeling to make an informed decision.

Also, libraries like statsmodels, Prophet and scikit-learn provide a wide range of tools and functionality for time series modeling in Python.
