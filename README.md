# Time_series #(otexts)
A time series is usually a sequence of data points that occur in successive order over some time, where the time interval is equal.

### Cleaning data

```py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load time series data from CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('time_series_data.csv')

# Check for missing values
print(df.isna().sum())

# Fill missing values using forward fill
df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

# Detect and remove outliers using z-score
z_scores = np.abs((df - df.mean()) / df.std())
df = df[z_scores < 3]

# Remove duplicates
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Normalize data using min-max scaling
df = (df - df.min()) / (df.max() - df.min())

# Save cleaned data to CSV file
df.to_csv('cleaned_time_series_data.csv', index=False)
```

## Trend
When data is plotted over time, we get a pattern that demonstrates how a series of numbers has moved to significantly higher or lower values over a lengthy period of time.It can be upward, downward or horizontal. The trend can be linear or non-linear and can be used to reveal long-term patterns in the data.

There are several techniques for identifying and analyzing trends in time series data using Python:

Visual Inspection: One of the simplest ways to identify trends in time series data is to plot the data and visually inspect the plot for patterns of long-term movements.

Linear Regression: A linear regression model can be used to fit a line to the data, which can be used to identify a linear trend. The slope of the line will indicate the direction and strength of the trend.

Polynomial Regression: If a linear trend is not present, a polynomial regression model can be used to fit a polynomial equation to the data, which can be used to identify a non-linear trend.

Moving Averages: A moving average is a technique that can be used to smooth out short-term fluctuations in the data and reveal long-term trends.

Time series models: Models such as ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) are commonly used for time-series forecasting, where trends can be captured by introducing trend components into the model and identifying their parameters.

Machine Learning models: Deep learning models, in particular, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are often used for time-series forecasting, in which recurrent layers with different architectures and properties can capture complex temporal dependencies, cycles, and patterns within the data, including trends.

Here's an example of how to use linear regression to identify a trend in a time series data in Python:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# format the data
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])
data.set_index('date', inplace=True)

# create an array of the index values
x = np.arange(len(data)).reshape(-1, 1)
y = data.values

# fit the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x, y)

# make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(x)

# plot the data and the trend line
plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
plt.plot(data, label='Original
```

## Seasonality

Seasonality in time series data refers to patterns of regular or semi-regular fluctuations that occur at a specific time of the year, such as daily, weekly, or yearly. These patterns can be caused by various factors such as weather, economic, social or cultural conditions, and they can have a significant impact on forecasting and modeling time series data.

There are several techniques for identifying and removing seasonality in time series data using Python:

[Removing Seasonality in a Time series](https://sirwilliam254.github.io/Time_series----Python-R----/DEseasonalizing_py.html)

Decomposition: One of the most common techniques for identifying seasonality is to use decomposition methods such as seasonal decomposition of time series (STL) or classical decomposition. These methods break down a time series into its component parts: trend, seasonal, and residual. The seasonal component represents the seasonality in the data.

Time series models: Models such as ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) are commonly used for time-series forecasting, where seasonality can be captured by introducing seasonal components into the model and identifying their parameters.

Machine Learning models: Deep learning models, in particular, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are often used for time-series forecasting, in which recurrent layers with different architectures and properties can capture complex temporal dependencies, cycles, and patterns within the data, including seasonality.

Here is an example of how to use the seasonal_decompose() function from the statsmodels library to decompose a time series and remove its seasonality in Python:

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# format the data
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])
data.set_index('date', inplace=True)

# perform seasonal decomposition
result = seasonal_decompose(data, model='multiplicative')

# extract the seasonal component
seasonal = result.seasonal

# remove the seasonal component from the original data
data_without_seasonality = data - seasonal

# plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
plt.subplot(311)
plt.plot(data, label='Original')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.subplot(312)
plt.plot(seasonal, label='Seasonal')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.subplot(313)
plt.plot(data_without_seasonality, label='Without Seasonality')
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

## Cycles

Cycles in time series data refer to patterns of regular or semi-regular fluctuations in the data that repeat over time. These patterns can have varying frequencies and amplitudes, and they can be caused by various factors such as economic, environmental, or societal influences.

There are several techniques for identifying and analyzing cycles in time series data, including:

Visual inspection: One of the simplest ways to identify cycles in time series data is to plot the data and visually inspect the plot for patterns of regular fluctuations.

Spectral analysis: This is a mathematical technique that can be used to identify the frequencies of the different cycles present in a time series. The most common method is the Fourier Transform, it decomposes a time series into its component frequencies, but also other methods like Wavelet Transform and Periodogram can be used.

Decomposition: This technique involves breaking down a time series into its component parts: trend, seasonal, and residual. This can reveal cycles in the data that correspond to the seasonal component.

Time series models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential smoothing and state-space models are commonly used for time-series forecasting, where cycles can be identified by examining the model parameters, in particular, the parameters that capture the dependencies between observations

Machine Learning models: Deep learning models, in particular, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are often used for Time-series forecasting, in which recurrent layers with different architectures and properties can capture complex temporal dependencies, cycles and patterns within the data.

It's important to note that cycles in time series data can be difficult to identify and analyze, as they may be caused by a combination of factors, and they may be obscured by other types of variations in the data. It's good to consult with experts in the field of time series analysis and use multiple techniques to identify and analyze cycles in your data.

## time series as a feature

Time series data can be used as a feature in various machine learning models. Using time series data as a feature can provide valuable information about trends, patterns, and dependencies in the data.

Here's an example of how to use time series data as a feature in a machine learning model using the popular library scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# format the data
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])
data.set_index('date', inplace=True)

# extract time series data as feature
ts_feature = data['time_series_column'].values

# extract other feature 
X = data[['other_feature_1', 'other_feature_2', ...]]

# split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# fit the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# evaluate the model
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
print(f'MSE: {mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)}')
print(f'R2: {r2_score(y_test, y_pred)}')

```

## Hybrid Modelling

Hybrid modeling in time series is a technique that combines different types of models to achieve better forecasting performance. The idea is to take advantage of the strengths of different models and to overcome their weaknesses by combining them in a way that produces more accurate predictions.

There are several ways to combine different time series models to form a hybrid model, including:

Model averaging: This method involves combining the predictions of multiple models by taking an average or a weighted average of the predictions. This can be useful when the performance of the individual models is similar.

Model switching: This method involves selecting the best model for a given time period based on the performance of the models on a validation dataset. This can be useful when the performance of the models varies over time.

Ensemble modeling: This method involves training multiple models on the same dataset and then combining their predictions using a technique like bagging or boosting. This can be useful when the individual models have high variance and are prone to overfitting.

Stacking: This method involves training multiple models on different subsets of the data, and then using the predictions of these models as input to a second-level model that makes the final prediction. This can be useful when the individual models have high bias and low variance.

Deep learning: This method involves using artificial neural networks to combine the predictions of multiple models. This can be useful when the relationships between the input and output variables are complex and non-linear.

Hybrid modeling can provide a more robust and accurate forecasting than using a single model. However, it's not always the case that hybrid model performs better than a single model, and can be computationally intensive, requires more data, and could be more difficult to interpret. It's important to evaluate the results of the different models, and to compare the performance of the hybrid model to that of the individual models to determine if the added complexity of the hybrid model is justified.

##  i.e

```python
# First, import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Next, load your data into a pandas dataframe
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Clean and prepare the data
data = data.dropna()

# Transform the data if necessary
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])
data.set_index('date', inplace=True)

# Decompose the time series into its components
decomposition = sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose(data, model='multiplicative')

# Fit an autoregressive model
ar = sm.tsa.AR(data).fit()

# Perform a hypothesis test to check for stationarity
result = sm.tsa.adfuller(data)

# Plot the results
decomposition.plot()
ar.plot_predict()
