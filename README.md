# Time_series #(otexts)
A time series is usually a sequence of data points that occur in successive order over some time, where the time interval is equal.
## Trend
When data is plotted over time, we get a pattern that demonstrates how a series of numbers has moved to significantly higher or lower values over a lengthy period of time.

## time series as a feature

Time series data can be used as a feature in various machine learning models. Using time series data as a feature can provide valuable information about trends, patterns, and dependencies in the data.

Here's an example of how to use time series data as a feature in a machine learning model using the popular library scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# format the data
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])
data.set_index('date', inplace=True)

# extract time series data as feature
ts_feature = data['time_series_column'].values

# extract other feature 
X = data[['other_feature_1', 'other_feature_2', ...]]

# split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# fit the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# evaluate the model
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
print(f'MSE: {mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)}')
print(f'R2: {r2_score(y_test, y_pred)}')

```

## Hybrid Modelling

Hybrid modeling in time series is a technique that combines different types of models to achieve better forecasting performance. The idea is to take advantage of the strengths of different models and to overcome their weaknesses by combining them in a way that produces more accurate predictions.

There are several ways to combine different time series models to form a hybrid model, including:

Model averaging: This method involves combining the predictions of multiple models by taking an average or a weighted average of the predictions. This can be useful when the performance of the individual models is similar.

Model switching: This method involves selecting the best model for a given time period based on the performance of the models on a validation dataset. This can be useful when the performance of the models varies over time.

Ensemble modeling: This method involves training multiple models on the same dataset and then combining their predictions using a technique like bagging or boosting. This can be useful when the individual models have high variance and are prone to overfitting.

Stacking: This method involves training multiple models on different subsets of the data, and then using the predictions of these models as input to a second-level model that makes the final prediction. This can be useful when the individual models have high bias and low variance.

Deep learning: This method involves using artificial neural networks to combine the predictions of multiple models. This can be useful when the relationships between the input and output variables are complex and non-linear.

Hybrid modeling can provide a more robust and accurate forecasting than using a single model. However, it's not always the case that hybrid model performs better than a single model, and can be computationally intensive, requires more data, and could be more difficult to interpret. It's important to evaluate the results of the different models, and to compare the performance of the hybrid model to that of the individual models to determine if the added complexity of the hybrid model is justified.

##  i.e

```python
# First, import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Next, load your data into a pandas dataframe
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Clean and prepare the data
data = data.dropna()

# Transform the data if necessary
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])
data.set_index('date', inplace=True)

# Decompose the time series into its components
decomposition = sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose(data, model='multiplicative')

# Fit an autoregressive model
ar = sm.tsa.AR(data).fit()

# Perform a hypothesis test to check for stationarity
result = sm.tsa.adfuller(data)

# Plot the results
decomposition.plot()
ar.plot_predict()
```
