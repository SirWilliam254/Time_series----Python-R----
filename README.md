# Time_series #(otexts)
A time series is usually a sequence of data points that occur in successive order over some time, where the time interval is equal.
## Trend
When data is plotted over time, we get a pattern that demonstrates how a series of numbers has moved to significantly higher or lower values over a lengthy period of time.
## Seasonality

## Cycles

## time series as a feature

## Hybrid Modelling


##  i.e

```python
# First, import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Next, load your data into a pandas dataframe
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Clean and prepare the data
data = data.dropna()

# Transform the data if necessary
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])
data.set_index('date', inplace=True)

# Decompose the time series into its components
decomposition = sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose(data, model='multiplicative')

# Fit an autoregressive model
ar = sm.tsa.AR(data).fit()

# Perform a hypothesis test to check for stationarity
result = sm.tsa.adfuller(data)

# Plot the results
decomposition.plot()
ar.plot_predict()
```
